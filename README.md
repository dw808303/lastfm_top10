# lastfm_top10

![](https://freeke.org/ffg/i/2025/lastfm_top10.png)

SwiftBar/xbar/bitbar plugin for displaying your week's [last.fm](https://last.fm) scrobbling activity.

Selecting the artist name takes you to the relevant last.fm artist page. You can also navigate directly to your last.fm profile by selecting that menu item.

Only tested in Swiftbar -- if there are any issues in xbar or bitbar, please let me know.

Uses SFSymbols on macOS for the menubar icon.  If there is a Windows or Linux bitbar equivalent, you'll probably need to substitute something else.
